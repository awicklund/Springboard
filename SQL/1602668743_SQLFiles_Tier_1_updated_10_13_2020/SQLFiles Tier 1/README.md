## Work locally via Python + SQLite

If you want to try work locally by executing your SQL queries directly on the `sqlite_db_pythonsqlite.db` database file then you can work with the `LocalSQLConnection.py` python script. Open the file `SQLTasks Tier 1.sql` for more a list of the questions we want to try answer.

There is already an example query in the file so if you just run the python script you should see something like:

```
# execute the python script
python LocalSQLConnection.py
```

Results should look like:
```
2.6.0
2. Query all tasks
(0, 'Tennis Court 1', 5, 25, 10000, 200)
(1, 'Tennis Court 2', 5, 25, 8000, 200)
(2, 'Badminton Court', 0, 15.5, 4000, 50)
(3, 'Table Tennis', 0, 5, 320, 10)
(4, 'Massage Room 1', 9.9, 80, 4000, 3000)
(5, 'Massage Room 2', 9.9, 80, 4000, 3000)
(6, 'Squash Court', 3.5, 17.5, 5000, 80)
(7, 'Snooker Table', 0, 5, 450, 15)
(8, 'Pool Table', 0, 5, 400, 15)
```

If you see this then things are working and you should be able to edit the file to add in any queries you want. 


## Work online via https://sql.springboard.com/

If you want to just log in somewhere and write SQL (no python involved) then you can go to https://sql.springboard.com/ log in with Username=student and Password=learn_sql@springboard and write and work on your SQL queries in there. Open the file `SQLTasks Tier 1.sql` for more a list of the questions we want to try answer and more information and instructions.
